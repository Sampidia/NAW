🎯 Objective

The main goal of Ayo is to capture more seeds (or stones) than your opponent by the end of the game.

🪵 Game Setup

The Ayo board has 12 holes (pits) arranged in two rows of six.

Each player controls the six pits on their side.

There are 48 seeds total — 4 seeds per pit at the start of the game.

Opponent side: [ 6  5  4  3  2  1 ]
Your side:     [ 1  2  3  4  5  6 ]

🧩 Gameplay (Turn Logic)

Choose a pit on your side that contains seeds.

Pick up all seeds from that pit.

Sow them counterclockwise, dropping one seed into each subsequent pit (including the opponent’s side), skipping only the pit you started from.

Continue sowing until you run out of seeds.

⚔️ Capturing Logic

After sowing:

You can capture any pits in your opponent's side that have exactly 3 seeds, regardless of where your last seed landed.

Chain-capture backward from any 3-seed pit until you reach a pit that doesn't have 3 seeds.

Captured seeds are kept in your "store" (or just set aside).

🧠 Strategic Rules

You cannot play from an empty pit.

You can play from any pit on your side that contains seeds (no "must feed opponent" requirement).

If your move would leave the opponent without any seeds (a "starvation" move), you must make a different move if possible.

The game continues until no more legal moves are possible or when 3 or fewer seeds remain.

🏆 Winning

When the game ends:

Only captured seeds count toward the final score. Any remaining seeds are discarded.

The player with the most captured seeds wins.
